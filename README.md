# React Motion Cards

Welcome to the React Motion Cards project! This React application utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, JavaScript for array mapping, and Framer Motion for animated card transitions. Below you'll find essential information to get started with the project.


## Project Overview

The React Motion Cards project aims to create an interactive web application where cards transition smoothly using Framer Motion animations. Each card is populated with data passed through props and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:git clone git@github.com:ashu6530/React-Motion-Cards.git
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Enter the project directory:cd React-Motion-Cards
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:npm install
4. **Start the Development Server**: Start the development server to run the React application:npm run dev
5. **Open in Browser**: Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the React Motion Cards application.

## Implementation Details

- **Props**: Data for each card is passed through props, allowing for dynamic content generation.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the cards and layout of the application. Utilize Tailwind's utility classes for rapid prototyping and responsive design.

- **Array Mapping**: JavaScript's array mapping functionality is employed to dynamically render multiple cards based on the provided data.

- **Framer Motion**: Framer Motion library is used for smooth animations of card transitions. Utilize Framer Motion's motion components to animate card movements, rotations, or any other interactive effects.
